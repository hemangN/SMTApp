	You are about to enter \"STAGE 1\" which is designed to study your smoking habits for 5 full days.</br>
	<u>It is highly recommended</u> to begin the stage with the new day for achieving clear results throughout! After completing \"STAGE 1\" you will be shown info on where you stand as a smoker and how long it is likely to take you to complete the whole therapy based on the results you have shown.</br>
	\"STAGE 2\" is when the actual program begins so it is also highly recommended that you start it with the beginning of next day! From that point on the app will be taking care of your smoking habit until the end!

   After a few months of studies, research, health stats collection and anonymous questionnaires we came up with a method, that helps people quit smoking without the need of a \"nicotine replacement\".
The mixture of technology, mathematics, our own studies and ideas brought this App to life. 
We truly believe in the positive results of our project and it\'s simply a matter of time you start believing too! Help us help other people get back to their smoke-free lifestyle by sharing and spreading the word about Smoke TherApp within your social networks.
